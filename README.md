# Harsh Kumar / README.md

I build backend systems that make ideas actually work in the real world.

From designing REST APIs and database schemas to implementing secure authentication and debugging production issues — I focus on what runs behind the scenes.

Some projects scaled. Some broke.  
Every one of them improved my engineering depth.
